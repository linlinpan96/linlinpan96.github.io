# Lin Lin Pan

Hi! My name is Lin Lin. I love the feeling of setting goals and working towards them. I struggle with moderation. My biggest fear is being a victim to inertia. I have difficulty staying motivated when I don't know the end goal I'm working towards. I really really value understanding things deeply. This bio is subject to change depending on my mood and season of life I'm in. - 2/19/26

Here, you'll find my musings on a range of topics - health, philosophy, money, love, technology, spirituality and more. These thoughts are subject to change in the face of new experiences and information.

*“The mind is an aviary, filled with birds flying around. The philosophical challenge is to land those birds and study them.” - Plato, paraphrased*
