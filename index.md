# Lin Lin Pan

Hi! My name is Lin Lin. I love the feeling of setting goals and working towards them. I struggle with moderation. My biggest fear is being a victim to inertia. I have difficulty staying motivated when I don't know the direction I'm going. This bio is subject to change depending on my mood and season of life I'm in. - 2/19/26
